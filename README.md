## Coding Challenge Drupal 8
The client has requested that we create a Drupal site that helps their executive staff coordinate travel plans and calendar events. As a first step in creating this site create a custom drupal module that exposes a service that accepts an email as input and a plugin to that service that parses the below email for airline reservations info. In future stories we will create the plumbing for receiving the emails, and plugins to handle other types of emails, but for this task the service and the reservations plugin are the only things that are required.


 ### Reservation Content Type

| Field Name | Machine Name | Description  |
| :---------|:--------------|:-------------------------------------|
| airline    | airline      | The airline the reservation is with. |

Please post the module code to GitHub or a Drupal.org sandbox project. While there is no time limit on the test, how long it took to complete, measured from first to last commit, will be a factor.
